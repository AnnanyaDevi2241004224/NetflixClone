# NetflixClone
Netflix is an American subscription video on-demand Internet streaming service. The service primarily distributes original and acquired films and television shows from various genres, and it is available internationally in multiple languages.
The Netflix clone project is a web application developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, aiming to replicate the user interface and some features of the popular streaming service, Netflix. Letâ€™s break down the project into its key components and functionalities. This project is implemented using a combination of three fundamental web technologies: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and JavaScript. Each of these technologies plays a crucial role in defining the structure, styling, and interactivity of the web application. To enhance user interaction, the JavaScript file introduces dynamic elements to the project.
